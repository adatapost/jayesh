ASP.NET 4.0 (VS 2010) - ASP.NET 4.5 (VS 2012)
=====================================================================

ASP.NET is web application infrastructure class library to develop and deploy enterprize (business) class web application. You can use the .net framework CLS compliant language to author the web-app. [C#, VB.NET, Managed C++ etc]

In short ASP.NET is an extended class library of .net framework. You can learn/see types from "System.Web namespace".

How many types of applications and application design is to created by the ASP.NET?
=====================================================================

 There are two types of web-apps created and deployed by the ASP.NET

   1. Web application (website) and
   2. Web Service application


There are following application-design pattern in ASP.NET to develop/deploy app:

   1. WebForm Application -- A single form/page is a "class" which 		includes HTML/CSS/JavaScript and C#/VB.NET code.

   2. MVC Application - This design seperate the code for different purposes including -- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (client or View code), C# code to perform database & data (Model code) and C# code which handle requests/responses (Controller)

   3. Single Page Application - It provide simple yet powerful design                                 pattern to develop pages just like in                                 PHP.

   4. Web Service Application - It implements RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) protocol to expose functionalities of classes remotely. This kind of system is known as WEB API.

 	Facebook, Twitter, Google etc uses web-api or web-service to         exopse their app's functionalities to clients.



What software needed to develop and deploy ASP.NET webapp?
===============================================================

1. The .net framework

2. Web-Server -- IIS - Internet Information Services (6 ot 7 or 8)

3. Visual Studio (optional) (VS is commertial product)
   OR
   Web Matrix from Microsoft and it is free
   OR
   Notepad or editor
   
4. Optionally database product - Oracle, MSSQL or MySql etc

Install the IIS  (Win7 or Win8)
===============================

 Control Panel + Programs & Features + Turn on/off windows features
  + [x] Web Management Tools 
    [x] World Wide Web services
  + OK to finish and installation will be started


Open web-browser and test http://localhost


Start/stop IIS
=============
Control Panel + Administrative Tools + IIS Manager

Home of IIS (Default document folder)
=========================================

C:\inetpub\wwwroot will be the default home (virtual) directory.

Create an application
=======================================================
Manually (Without using VS)
========

  1. Create a folder anywhere but atlest you've write/read/delete 	permission.
  2. IIS Manager + Expand + MACHINE NAME + Sites  + Default Sites + right click to "Add Application" -- Set /virtualPath and c:\x\x absolute path.  (e.g c:\csnet\test-app is the actual path and /test is virtual path)

 2.   Create "Default.aspx" -- 'Default' is home page name

      By default programming language is VB.NET.

Default.aspx (VB)
==================
 
<!doctype html>

<html>
  <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8"/>
     <title>ASP.NET</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Welcome Home</h1>
      <%
         Dim no = 10
       %>
      <p>Value : <%=no%></p>
   </body>
</html>


Default.aspx (C#)
==================
<%@Page Language="C#"%>
<!doctype html>

<html>
  <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8"/>
     <title>ASP.NET</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Welcome Home</h1>
      <%
        int no = 10;
       %>
      <p>Value : <%=no%></p>
   </body>
</html>

After that open http://localhost/test


Using Visual Studio
===================

File + New + WebSite + Web Location="Http" - http://localhost/siteName + OK

Working with IISExpress web-server
===================================================================
This web-server installed with VS and you can use it to test the webapp even in absense of IIS.

 In VS, choose Web Location="FileSystem" and create app in any other   folder.

 IISExpress or Development Server will be started when you press F5  (Debug + Run with or without debug).

 Each running webapp is assigned a unique but dynamic port.  http://localhost:54333/siteName
