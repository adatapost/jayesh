ASP.NET WebApp/WebSite files and directory structure
====================================================================
A website/webapp is madeup of number of resources (static & dynamic). With ASP.NET WebForm application, we must have to stick standard directory structure.


1. Home Page  
   Home Page name is "Default.aspx". It will be executed automatically    when url include no-file name.

   PS: It is important to add default.aspx per folder to avoid       directory listing.

2. web.config -- Application configuration file used to overrride the
   default settings.

   There can be one or more web.config but the first one that is    located at root (/ or ~) is entry-point (main).

3. global.asax -- Application event class (file). This file must be    located at the root and you can use this file to handle application,     session or request specific events.


4. Special purpose folders

   There are some special purpose folders exists in wbsite and they    have finit or designate purpose.

   1. Bin -- Any DLL assembly you wish to use in your web-site must be
	     copied under "Bin" folder.

Example: Create Library Project + Name the Project (e.g MyApp) + Add some public          classes + Build it. (MyApp.dll)

        Create website + add "Bin" folder can copy MyApp.dll into "Bin"

         OR

       WebSite Menu + Add Reference + Browse to .dll file

 2. App_Code -- Any component (class/interface/delegate etc) you wish     to create in website must be placed inside the App_code folder. If .cs file is not copied into App_code then file wont be compiled.


 3. App_Data -- Any local database (MsAccess, XML, or MSSSQL) must be                 placed inside the App_Data.

 4. App_GlobalResources and 
 5. App_LocalResources    -- It creates resource documents (XML) to     store language and culture specific data/messages/strings/images.
 
 6. App_Browsers and Theme are not recommended features.


Apart from the current folder structure, you can add folders for JavaScripts (Scripts), Styles (for CSS), Admin, Manager, Customer to store user-specific files/programs etc.
