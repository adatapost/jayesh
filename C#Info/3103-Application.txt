ASP.NET WebForm Application Domain
===================================================================
ASP.NET webapp uses lazy-initialization technique. Once an application is deployed it wont be started / launched automatically. The ASP.NET app will be started when first request is coming from the client and then it be started till the hosting OS or WebServer is not shutdown or errornious condition occurs. 

In case of error conditions, the webapp re-started automatically. The webapp calls Application_Start, Application_Stop or Application_Error events appropriately.


NOTE: You can handle application_start,stop and error events using Global.asax file.

 Example:

  Add Global.asax in your webapp and test it.

 void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e) 
    {
        // Code that runs on application startup
        System.IO.File.AppendAllText(@"c:\csnet\jayesh\info.txt", "Start Date : " + DateTime.Now + "\r\n");
       
    }
    
    void Application_End(object sender, EventArgs e) 
    {
        //  Code that runs on application shutdown
        System.IO.File.AppendAllText(@"c:\csnet\jayesh\info.txt", "End Date : " + DateTime.Now + "\r\n");
       
    }
        
    void Application_Error(object sender, EventArgs e) 
    { 
        // Code that runs when an unhandled error occurs

        System.IO.File.AppendAllText(@"c:\csnet\jayesh\info.txt", "App Error : " + DateTime.Now + "\r\n");
       
        
    }
