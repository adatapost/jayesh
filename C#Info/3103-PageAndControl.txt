ASP.NET Controls and Page
======================================================================

ASP.NET Controls and page as classes located at System.Web Namespace and its sub-namespaces.

The System.Web.UI.Control is the super class of all controls including WebServer Controls, HTMLControls, CustomeControls, UserControl and Pages.
 

There are two direct types of Control (ie. They are derived from Control class)

1. Web Server Controls -- These are ASP.NET classes which produce (emit)   dynamic content of HTML/CSS and JavaScript when they are   rendered/processed.

2. HTML Server Controls --- Each html tag has appropriate class exists in ASP.NET class library. The HTML tag is processed only by the web-browser but in case if you want to use HTML tag with C# language then you have to convert HTML tag into HTML Server Control by setting two extra properties:

   <p id="para1" runat="server"></p>

 and you can access this control via C# code:

   para1.innerHTML = "Hello World";

However you can use same DOM in web-brwoser via JavaScript:

      <script>
            var d = document.getElementById("para1");
            console.log(d.innerHTML);
        </script>


HTML Server Controls are just HTML tags. They don't have extra feature and we cannot extends HTML Server controls because we are not allowed to create new tags.

In case of WebServer Controls, they are developed using OOP and allow support to extends their abilities. In fact, web-server controls are not replacement of HTML tags/Controls because they offer much much features especially they prevent Script Injection, validate user's requests, encode/decode HTML tags and so on.

 Example: Add "TextBox1" into .aspx and request that .aspx page. Type following content in Textbox and submit it:

    <h1>Hello</h1> + Submit <==== ASP.NET's WEbServer Controls raises                                   RequestValidation error.



Sub classes of System.Web.UI.Control are

1.  System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl (WEb Server Control)
2.  System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlControl (Html Server Control)
3.  System.Web.UI.Page,Master etc are sub-class of Control class.


Common Properties and Methods of Control class
=====================================================
1. ID -- Unique id of control that is used by Server program
2. ClientID -- Unique Id of control that is used by client (JavaScript) 		code.

3. Visible - To hide/show control
             Visible=false will stop the render.

4. Parent - Refere the parent control

5. Page - Refere the page on which it is hosted.

6. Controls -- Collection of children

7. Render() methods -- These methods are responsible to generate HTML    content from the current properties of Control.
