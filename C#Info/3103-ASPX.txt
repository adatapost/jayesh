The ASPX Page
====================================================================

The .aspx page (.aspx is an extension of regular text file). When you rename any regular text document to .aspx then ASP.NET server automatically consider it as a "class".

For example,

 sample.aspx (without code) is a class whose name is "sample_aspx" and will be stored into "sample_aspx.cs" code file when it is compiled.

 public class sample_aspx: Page ...{}

 It means any .aspx page must inherits the System.Web.UI.Page class.


.ASPX Page Model
================

In website, you have two types of Page models that you can use any one of them to design or define .aspx page.

1. Code inline model -- A single .aspx file which contains    HTML/CSS/JavaScript and C# code.

<%@ Page Language="C#" %>

<!doctype html>

<script runat="server">
  C# event code
</script>
<html>
  ......
</html>

2. Code-behind model -- Two files namely xxxxx.aspx and xxxxx.aspx.cs will be created to save "Markup" into .aspx and code in .aspx.cs file.


  Code-behind model is supported by the VS so you have to use "code-  inline" if you are not using VS.
